# DAEEbiomarkerï¼šData-Adaptive Efficient Estimation Strategies for Biomarker Studies Embedded in Randomized Trials

# Overview

This package implements efficient estimation for the prognostic or predictive value of a biomarker in randomized clinical trials. Two study settings in
terms of biomarker ascertainment are considered. One is the complete-data setting in which the biomarker is measured for all subjects in the trial, and the other is the two-phase sampling design in which the biomarker
is measured retrospectively for a random subsample of subjects selected in an outcome-dependent fashion.
